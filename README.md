This notebook is based on https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doleron/simple-object-detector-from-scratch/

The main branch contains a rewritten version of the original notebook that utilizes the same dataset as the original notebook does.
The branch integrateCarDataset contains the integration of a different dataset into the original notebook. However, it turns out that the model is to small to be able to tell cars apart. The model is heavily underfitting. Therefore, this integration of the cars dataset is not merged into the rewritten version
